# OpenTrack

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

Welcome to OpenTrack, an open-source platform for extracting training load variables from IMU data. The initial OpenTrack release can be used with triaxial accelerometer or 9-axis IMU data, and is functional with a single central device, and/or two devices corresponding to left and right limbs.

The current version of OpenTrack outputs impact counts and magnitudes, jump counts and heights, PlayerLoad, and other common training load variables, as well as both raw and processed time-series for each device. It is also designed to work with both .csv and SQL databases, which can be edited from within the platform.


## Installation

To run OpenTrack, you will need to 1) make a copy of this repository in your system's 'R' folder, and 2) download and install the package using:

``` r
install_github("joseph-shaw/OpenTrack")
```

You will also need to alter several of the files within the settings folder ("~ R/OpenTrack/settings") before you get started.

 - athletes.csv:       This file houses data about each athlete. You can edit to this directly, or do so through the 'Add athlete' tab in the "Analyse Data" page in the app.
 
 - sql.csv:            This file is used to create a SQL connection, or tell the app to use csv files instead (set the 'csv' cell to 0). To set up a SQL connection, add in the database information in each cell. You'll be prompted to enter the password each time you open the app (entry box in the r studio window; nothing will work until this is entered correctly). You can add a password permanently in the 'app_server.R' file instead.

 - lists.csv:          You can use this file to change the session type options in the drop down on the 'Analyse Data' page.
 
 - filepaths.csv:      You will need to change these if you want to edit where the app can look for files. Simply enter the filepaths and a name for the location you want to use.
 
 - export.csv:         This file can be used to change the data that is exported. Simply delete a column to remove it from the export.




## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(OpenTrack)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
